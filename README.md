## Hi there, I'm Nicolás Rojas 👋

I’m a data engineer with a backend background. Most of my work is around building data pipelines, real-time systems, and automation in Python.

I like working close to the data and the system itself. I care about how things behave under load, how failures are handled, and whether something is actually usable in production.



I learn best by building things. When I want to understand a tool or concept, I usually turn it into a small project and improve it step by step, instead of just following tutorials.

Outside of engineering, I enjoy sports, climbing, learning languages, and working on long-term skills.
